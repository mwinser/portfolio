          <p>I'm a former Sleep Scientist (yes, that is a thing) and I currently work as a polysomnographer in clinical sleep medicine in beautiful Spokane, WA.
          </p>
          <p>In October 2020, I began seriously learning web development with freeCodeCamp and have created this website to show off some of my work. 
          I've always loved solving problems and making stuff.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some of the technologies I use:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and React</li>
            <li>Node.js, express, MongoDB and Mongoose</li>
            <li>C#, Unity and Python</li>
          </ul>
